# Answer Code

1. I have added 3 files, index.html, index,js and style.css. Once the API server has been started launch the web page and the app will work.
2. I have used axios to get the data about boroughs and then dynamically manipulated the DOM to display a drop down list of boroughs. Once a user selects a borough I again have dynamically manipulated the DOM to display a table of coffee shop data.
